# Japanese Rail Lines Browser

This project provides a static web page for exploring the major rail lines across Japan. There is no build process or npm setup required; simply open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.

For convenience, you can also serve the page locally with a simple HTTP server, such as:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to browse the site.
